# News Site

This is a football news site that targets a specific footballer, Lionel Messi. 
In this assignment I've tried to make the page responsive through using flexbox.


## The problem

I used flexbox to make my site responsive. The flexbox in combination with adding media queries made the responsivness work in the end. I used an animation effect called bounce which will make the cards bounce if you target them with the mouse. Other than that I used box shadow as well, a few different fonts and got my inspiration for the news site subject from something I really care about, football. It was quite hard to make the site responsive since I got different leads from different pages.
