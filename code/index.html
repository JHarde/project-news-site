        <h1>The end of Messi in Barcelona?</h1>
      <p>Following FC Barcelonas huge 8-2 loss in the Champions League against Bayern Münich rumours are sparking about Lionel Messi wanting to leave the club. 
        The 33-year old forward came to Barcelona only as a 13-year old and is by many considered to be the best football player the world has ever seen. 
        He has won the <em>Champions League</em> four times, <em>La Liga</em> 10 times and <em>Copa del Rey</em> with Argentina as much as six times. 
        He is also the only player to have won the Ballon dór six times, followed by his biggest rival Cristiano Ronaldo at five. 
        The prize is awarded the worlds best footballer each year. 
        A reason to Messis likely departure might be that Barcelonas new coach Ronald Koeman told Messi's close friend and striking partner, 
        Luis Suarez, he does not wish the Uruguayan to stay at the club. 
        During the last 12 months there has also been an open conflict between Messi and the club president Josep Maria Bartomeu.
        According to sources, Messi has been unhappy with how the club is being run under Bartomeu. At the moment it looks like PSG and Man City are closest to signing the argentinian wizard.</p>
        <h3>Messi's outstanding stats in FC Barcelona:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>731 matches</li>
          <li>634 goals</li>
          <li>285 assist</li>
        </ul>
